## About the Dataset
I collected the Time Series data from my mother store. Data size covers 3 years since the store has been in existence and total sales at the end of each day were recorded.

A simple ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) was used and achieved a 965 RMSE score. Bad? I plan to explore many other options in the coming days

cheers
